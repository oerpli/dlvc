\begin{abstract}
This is the report for the second assignment of the course ``Deep Learning for Visual Computing'' in the winter term 2016 at the TU Vienna. The task was to build a linear model to classify images of  the CIFAR10 dataset \TODO
\end{abstract}


\section{Deep Learning Libraries}
% Briefly state which deep learning library you used and if you used the server for training. One or two sentences are sufficient.
We used Keras with tensorflow as backend for training. We used the server since we could not get the system running on a Windows platform. For development, we used Keras with theano backend which caused a lot of trouble due to the different channel ordering.


\section{Linear Models}
% Describe what parametric models are and how they differ from the k nearest neighbors classifier we used in Assignment 1. Describe what a linear model is and how these models are used for classification. What to the parameters (weights and biases) of linear classifiers specify?

\caption{Accuracy of kNN classification with neighborhood sizes (k) and L1 and L2 norms on raw image and HOG vectors. Classification on HOG consistently outperforms classification on raw data. Furthermore kNN with L1 distance metric is superior to kNN with L2 distance metric. Performance of best parameters ($k=21, \text{L1 norm}$) on test set with raw \plotref{t2} and HOG data \plotref{t1}. }
