\section{The Importance of Features} %Think about reasons why performing kNN classification directly on the raw images does not work well. Describe what a feature is and why operating on features instead of raw images is beneficial in case of kNN. Briefly explain what HOG features are. Compare the results when using these features (knn_classify_hog_tinycifar10.py) to those obtained using raw images and discuss them. Even with HOG features, the performance is still much lower than that of CNNs (90\% accuracy and more on the whole dataset). Think of reasons for why this is the case.
