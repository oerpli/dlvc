\section{Preprocessing}
\subsection{Explain the purpose of preprocessing.}
\subsection{How do per-sample normalization and per-trainingset normalization differ in terms of operation and purpose?}
\subsection{In the latter case, which (if any) preprocessing is applied during validation and testing?}

\section{Optimization vs ML}
\subsection{What are the goals of optimization and machine learning?}
In optimization the goal is to find an optimal value for a function, 
\subsection{Why do they differ?}
\subsection{Create two sketches with each showing the training progress over time in terms of both training and test error; one that is good from an optimization perspective but bad from a machine learning perspective, and one that is worse from an optimization perspective but better from a machine learning perspective. Explain both sketches.}

\section{Regularization}
\subsection{What is the purpose of regularization?}
\subsection{What is weight decay and what is its purpose?}
\subsection{What is early stopping and how does it work?}
\subsection{In deep learning, is it better to increase regularization or to decrease the model capacity by other means, and why?}



\section{MLP}
\subsection{What is the definition of a multilayer perceptron?}
\subsection{What operation do (non-input) units perform?}
\subsection{What is an activation function and which functions are common?}
\subsection{Draw a sketch that shows the layers of such networks and how the individual units are connected.}

\section{MLP for VC}
\subsection{Why are multilayer perceptrons not suitable for deep learning for image analysis?}

\section{Oversampling}
\subsection{What is the purpose of oversampling and how does it work?}
\subsection{What is ten-crop oversampling?}
\subsection{Assume the task of dog breed classification.}
