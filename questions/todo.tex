\section{Preprocessing}
\subsection{Explain the purpose of preprocessing.}
\subsection{How do per-sample normalization and per-trainingset normalization differ in terms of operation and purpose?}
\subsection{In the latter case, which (if any) preprocessing is applied during validation and testing?}

\section{Optimization vs ML}
\subsection{What are the goals of optimization and machine learning?}
In optimization the goal is to find an optimal value for a function, 
\subsection{Why do they differ?}
\subsection{Create two sketches with each showing the training progress over time in terms of both training and test error; one that is good from an optimization perspective but bad from a machine learning perspective, and one that is worse from an optimization perspective but better from a machine learning perspective. Explain both sketches.}

\section{Regularization}
\subsection{What is the purpose of regularization?}
\subsection{What is weight decay and what is its purpose?}
\subsection{What is early stopping and how does it work?}
\subsection{In deep learning, is it better to increase regularization or to decrease the model capacity by other means, and why?}



\section{CNN backends}
\subsection{What is the backend of a CNN?}
\subsection{Discuss the backends of VGGNet and GoogLeNet/ResNet and their pros and cons.}




\section{Dropout}
\subsection{What is the purpose of dropout, how does it work, and why is it effective?}
\subsection{Why do ``dropped'' neurons have no effect on the output of the next layer?}
\subsection{To which CNN layers is dropout commonly applied?}

\section{Batch normalization}
\subsection{What is the purpose and aim of batch normalization?}
\subsection{Why does it have a regularizing effect?}
\subsection{To which CNN layers is batch normalization applied and where?}

\section{Oversampling}
\subsection{What is the purpose of oversampling and how does it work?}
\subsection{What is ten-crop oversampling?}
\subsection{Assume the task of dog breed classification.}
\subsection{Think of and explain transformations that are applicable in this case. What about ten-crop oversampling?}

\section{Model ensembles}
\subsection{What is the purpose and intuition behind using model ensembles?}
\subsection{How might the individual models differ from each other?}
\subsection{How is the output of these models combined?}

\section{CNNs in medical imaging}
\subsection{What approaches are key components to use deep CNNs in medical imaging applications, especially when data for training is not or sparsely available?}
\subsection{Describe two approaches and the benefit of using them in medical imaging.}
